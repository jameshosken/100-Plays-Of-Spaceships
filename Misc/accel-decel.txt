Accel/decel algaorithm for autonomous spaceship with stationary target:

Context:
	d = v/t

	a = (vf-vi)/t

	Required a = (0-vi)/t = -v/t
		t being time to traverse distance at current v

	when required a >= max a, start decelerating

Alg:

if(not within target radius):

	- Get max acceleration of ship (a_m)

	- Determine velocity [v] relative to target

	- Determine distance [d] to target

	- Determine time to target [t]  (= d/v)

	- If (-v)/t >= a_m, start decelerating, else accelerate.

else:
	- reduce v to 0



*New Constraint: non-stationary start.

thrustTargetPosition = desiredTargetPosition - velocityVector 
thrustVector = thrustTargetPosition - currentPosition

*New Constraint: Can only thrust forward

To rotate towards thrust vector:

For rotation:

- Find angle of rotation (cross product of current fwd and target.)
