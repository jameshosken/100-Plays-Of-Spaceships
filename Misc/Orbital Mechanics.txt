Conic Section - plane intersection of a one that describes a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola


Orbital Elements:
- Semi-Major Axis - 1,
- Eccentricity -e, 
- Inclination - i,
- Argument of Periapses - w,
- Time of Periapsis Passage - T,
- Longitude of Ascending Node - Omega

- Period P = time to complete one orbit
- True Anomaly = Angular distance from point in orbit past the Periapsis


e = dist(foci) / major Axis

i = angular distance between orbital plane and equator or ecliptic plane

periapsis = point closest to primary
apoapsis = point furthest from primary

Argument of Periapsis = angular distance between ascending Node and point of periapsis

Time of Periapses = time in which satellite moves through periapsis

Node = point where orbit crosses plane
    South to North = ascending Node


# Circular Motion

Constant acceleration inwards (centripetal), described by:

a = v^2 / r (thus F = m*v^2 / r)

v^2 / r = G*M / r^2 

v = sqrt(G * M / r)




Basic equation of planetary motion
p^2 = 4*PI^2*r^3 / GM

    Holds for ellipses if r is semi-major axis

For hyperbolics:
ℓ = "width" of orbit
ℓ=a(1−e2).

Things we must determine:

- a (or ℓ)
- e (eccentricity)
- periapsis - rp=a(1−e)
- apoapsis  - ra=a(1+e)
